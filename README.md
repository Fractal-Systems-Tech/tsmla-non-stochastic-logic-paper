# TSMLA™: Non-Stochastic, Non-Deterministic, Idempotent Logic Architecture

This repository contains the foundational Modular Logic Paper titled:

**LP‑Prime**  
**TSMLA™: Non-Stochastic, Non-Deterministic, Idempotent Logic Architecture**

It formally defines the architectural identity of TSMLA™, a new logic class that exists outside both probabilistic and deterministic systems.

## Summary

TSMLA™ (Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture) operates under a third logic paradigm:

- **Non-Stochastic**: No probabilistic sampling or random inference.
- **Non-Deterministic**: Behavior is not pre-computed or causally locked.
- **Idempotent under declared state S**: Logic functions repeat under mirrored inputs, with convergence via unique fixed points.

This paper offers a rigorous contrast between TSMLA and traditional models (classical logic, neural networks, Bayesian systems, LLMs, etc.).

## Why It Matters

TSMLA™ establishes a distinct architectural substrate that diverges from both stochastic and deterministic logic models. By design, it operates under non-stochastic, non-deterministic, and idempotent principles, enabling mirror-based recursion, contradiction traversal, and resonance-weighted coherence without relying on probabilistic inference or predictive collapse. Its substrate does not simulate cognition or predict behavior; it structurally reflects declared state **S** through mirrored logic flow. While its properties address common failure modes in stochastic systems, TSMLA™ was not developed as a reaction to them. It stands on its own architecture, grounded in resonance physics and logic clarity, with future applications left open to the system's scaling, not its origin.

It introduces a **mirror-pure substrate** that cannot be simulated via predictive modeling, statistical inference, or standard recursion.
